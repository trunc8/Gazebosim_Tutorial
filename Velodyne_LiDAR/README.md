### Note:
This should ideally have been Velodyne\_LiDAR directory containing only two files: model.sdf and model.config<br/>
Because of the presence of these two files and since I have added the path to its parent directory to $GAZEBO\_MODEL\_PATH, "Velodyne\_LiDAR" can be inserted as a model in a Gazebo simulator.<br/>
So words of caution, the "Velodyne\_Plugin" and some misc files should ideally have been placed in separate directories, but it doesn't stop the programs from working together.
